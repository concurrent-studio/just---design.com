	- "The colonial genealogy of the contemporary nation-state border frames any politics of their opening. Borders are opened when they are approached, conceptually and practically, as ambivalent, porous, fluid, and negotiated.

I don't know if you have known anybody from that far back, if you have loved anybody that long, first as an infant, then as a child, then as a man. You gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort." (Taken from source)

Silva proposes that the notion of racial difference governs the global power configuration because it institutes moral regions not covered by post-Enlightenment ethical ideals."

	- "Some 25 years after its publication, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's “Can the Subaltern Speak?” continues to cause an ethical consternation not fully explicable by its apparent political claims.

	- "In an age when it is so common for progressive, cosmopolitan intellectuals (particularly in Europe?) to insist on the near-pathological character of nationalism, its roots in fear and hatred of the Other, and its affinities with racism, it is useful to remind ourselves that nations inspire love, and often profoundly self-sacrificing love."

	- Authored by [Homi K. Bhabha](https://complit.fas.harvard.edu/people/homi-k-bhabha)
	- "The discourse of post-Enlightenment English colonialism often speaks in a tongue that is forked, not false. If colonialism takes power in the name of history, it repeatedly exercises its authority through the figures of farce. For the epic intention of the civilizing mission, "human and not wholly human" in the famous words of Lord Rosebery, "writ by the finger of the Divine" often produces a text rich in the traditions of trompe l'oeil, irony, mimicry, and repetition. In this comic turn from the high ideals of the colonial imagination to its low mimetic literary effects, mimicry emerges as one of the most elusive and effective strategies of colonial power and knowledge."

	- Authored by [Enrique Dussel](https://enriquedussel.com/Home_en.html)
	- "In this book, I consider a constellation which European or United States thinkers often neglect and which involves far more than what Ihab Hassan has called an "ideological commitment to minorities in politics, sex, and language."2 I focus on the immense majority of humanity, the seventy-five per cent of the world situated in the southern hemisphere, the excolonial world. These exploited, excluded, and poor peoples, whom Fanon termed the "wretched of the earth," consume less than fifteen per cent of the planet's income. Their history of oppression began five hundred years ago." (Taken from source)

	- Authored by [Edward W. Said](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-Said)
	- "Appeals to the past are among the commonest of strategies in interpretations of the present. What animates such appeals is not only disagree- . ment about what happened in the past and .what the past was, but uncenainty about whether the past really is past, over and concluded, or whether it continues, albeit in di1ferent forms, perhaps. This problem animates all sorts of discussions--about influence, about blame and judgement, about present actualities and future priorities." (Taken from source)

	- Authored by [Jeffrey C. Stone](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1368779.Jeffrey_C_Stone)
	- "The long-standing view of an eighteenth century cartographic reformation of Africa is challenged. Pre-colonial cartography of Africa is, instead, characterized by methodological continuity, which is still evident in the cartography of the nineteenth century European explorers, whereas the major discontinuity coincides with the beginnings of colonial rule. The cartographic requirements for the implementation of colonial rule on the ground are different from those which foster a more remote imperial relationship. The attributes of imperial cartography are now reasserting themselves in the post-colonial period." (Taken from source)

	- "The first edition of this book, published in 1994, reshaped the direction of landscape studies by considering landscape not simply as an object to be seen or a text to be read, but as an instrument of cultural force, a central tool in the creation of national and social identities."

	- "The essays we bring together in this volume and which together we present to the English reader represent stages in our own personal work for which we each assume responsibility. Circumstances have, however, made them the elements of a dialogue which has grown closer in recent years and which we would now like to share with the reader. It is our contribution to the elucidation of a burning question: What is the specificity of contemporary racism? How can it be related to class division within capitalism and to the contradictions of the nation-state? And, conversely, in what respects does the phenomenon of racism lead us to rethink the articulation of nationalism and the class stuggle?" (Taken from source)

	- "What is termed globalization is the culmination of a process that began with the constitution of America and colonial/modern Eurocentered capitalism as a new global power. One of the fundamental axes of this model of power is the social classification of the world’s population around the idea of race, a mental construction that expresses the basic experience of colonial domination and pervades the more important dimensions of global power, including its specific rationality: Eurocentrism."

	- Authored by [Samia Henni](https://aap.cornell.edu/people/samia-henni)
	- "The frame of reference for the vast majority of architectural histories and theories is central Europe and northern America, which often exclude the dynamic histories of colonialism, extraction, imperialism, migration, slavery, and wars, in spite of the fact that architects, decision makers, and populations have always been involved in these activities. What is often called “peripheries,” “Global South,” “developing countries,” “non-Western world,” or the “Other” exists in reference or in opposition to the so-called “centers,” “Global North,” “developed countries,” “Western-world,” or the “Self.” This set of measurements derives from and results in a world order that has colonial features. The assessment of the validity of architecture and its histories and theories is based on certain notions, paradigms, figures, forms, texts, buildings, and styles. This mechanism of evaluation regulates the understanding and interpretation of architecture, as well as the inclusion and exclusion of its histories and theories. It also promotes and privileges certain cultural and intellectual aspects over others. Consequently, these criteria play a crucial role in institutionalizing architectural histories and theories."

	- Authored by [Brenna Bhandar](https://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staff86676.php)
	- "In Colonial Lives of Property Brenna Bhandar examines how modern property law contributes to the formation of racial subjects in settler colonies and to the development of racial capitalism. Examining both historical cases and ongoing processes of settler colonialism in Canada, Australia, and Israel and Palestine, Bhandar shows how the colonial appropriation of indigenous lands depends upon ideologies of European racial superiority as well as upon legal narratives that equate civilized life with English concepts of property."

	- Authored by [Dipesh Chakrabarty](https://history.uchicago.edu/directory/dipesh-chakrabarty)
	- "First published in 2000, Dipesh Chakrabarty’s influential Provincializing Europe addresses the mythical figure of Europe that is often taken to be the original site of modernity in many histories of capitalist transition in non-Western countries. This imaginary Europe, Dipesh Chakrabarty argues, is built into the social sciences. The very idea of historicizing carries with it some peculiarly European assumptions about disenchanted space, secular time, and sovereignty. Measured against such mythical standards, capitalist transition in the third world has often seemed either incomplete or lacking."

	- Authored by [Partha Chatterjee](https://anthropology.columbia.edu/content/partha-chatterjee)
	- "In this book, the prominent theorist Partha Chatterjee looks at the creative and powerful results of the nationalist imagination in Asia and Africa that are posited not on identity but on difference with the nationalism propagated by the West. Arguing that scholars have been mistaken in equating political nationalism with nationalism as such, he shows how anticolonialist nationalists produced their own domain of sovereignty within colonial society well before beginning their political battle with the imperial power. These nationalists divided their culture into material and spiritual domains, and staked an early claim to the spiritual sphere, represented by religion, caste, women and the family, and peasants. Chatterjee shows how middle-class elites first imagined the nation into being in this spiritual dimension and then readied it for political contest, all the while “normalizing” the aspirations of the various marginal groups that typify the spiritual sphere."

- [**The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness**](http://kemetdevelopment.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Paul-Gilroy-The-Black-Atlantic.pdf) [<sup>2<sup>](#Sources)
	- Authored by [Paul Gilroy](https://www.gold.ac.uk/honorands/paul-gilroy/)
	- "Afrocentrism. Eurocentrism. Caribbean Studies. British Studies. To the forces of cultural nationalism hunkered down in their camps, this bold book sounds a liberating call. There is, Paul Gilroy tells us, a culture that is not specifically African, American, Caribbean, or British, but all of these at once, a black Atlantic culture whose themes and techniques transcend ethnicity and nationality to produce something new and, until now, unremarked. Challenging the practices and assumptions of cultural studies, The Black Atlantic also complicates and enriches our understanding of modernism."

- [**Imperial Debris: On Ruins and Ruination**](https://instruct.uwo.ca/geog/9322/Stoler2008.pdf) [<sup>2<sup>](#Sources)
	- Authored by [Ann Laura Stoler](https://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty/ann-stoler/)
	- "Imperial Debris redirects critical focus from ruins as evidence of the past to "ruination" as the processes through which imperial power occupies the present. Ann Laura Stoler's introduction is a manifesto, a compelling call for postcolonial studies to expand its analytical scope to address the toxic but less perceptible corrosions and violent accruals of colonial aftermaths, as well as their durable traces on the material environment and people's bodies and minds."

- [**Imperial Leather: Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Colonial Contest**](https://selforganizedseminar.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mcclintock_imperial-leather.pdf) [<sup>2<sup>](#Sources)
	- Authored by [Anne McClintock](https://gss.princeton.edu/anne-mcclintock)
	- "Imperial Leather chronicles the dangerous liaisons between gender, race and class that shaped British imperialism and its bloody dismantling. Spanning the century between Victorian Britain and the current struggle for power in South Africa, the book takes up the complex relationships between race and sexuality, fetishism and money, gender and violence, domesticity and the imperial market, and the gendering of nationalism within the zones of imperial and anti-imperial power."

	- Authored by [Kathryn Yusoff](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/geog/staff/yusoffk.html)
	- "Kathryn Yusoff examines how the grammar of geology is foundational to establishing the extractive economies of subjective life and the earth under colonialism and slavery. She initiates a transdisciplinary conversation between black feminist theory, geography, and the earth sciences, addressing the politics of the Anthropocene within the context of race, materiality, deep time, and the afterlives of geology."
