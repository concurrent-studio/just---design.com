In this constant state of flux, our images become a revival for the under-represented and under-acknowledged; Reminders of the space we have claimed for ourselves to model a future that celebrates and uplifts us. We believe in the power of creating our own imagery to explore the design of multiple idealized futures. In an effort to reclaim our narrative we celebrate the invisibles with the representation of black and brown bodies through our digital catalog of over 350 cutouts from all over the world. We believe in the power of creating our own imagery through a collaborative process that uncovers hidden ideas capable of creating unlimited frontiers.”",
