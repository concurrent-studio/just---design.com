	- Authored by [Paulo Freire](https://www.freire.org/paulo-freire/)
	- "Dedicated to the oppressed and based on his own experience helping Brazilian adults to read and write, Freire includes a detailed Marxist class analysis in his exploration of the relationship between the colonizer and the colonized. In the book, Freire calls traditional pedagogy the "banking model of education" because it treats the student as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge, like a piggy bank. He argues that pedagogy should instead treat the learner as a co-creator of knowledge." [Summary c/o Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed)

- [**The Black Skyscraper: Architecture and the Perception of Race**]() {2}
	- Authored by [Adrienne Brown](https://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/adrienne-brown)
	- "With the development of the first skyscrapers in the 1880s, urban built environments could expand vertically as well as horizontally. Tall buildings emerged in growing cities to house and manage the large and racially diverse populations of migrants and immigrants flocking to their centers following Reconstruction. Beginning with Chicago's early 10-story towers and concluding with the 1931 erection of the 102-story Empire State Building, Adrienne Brown's The Black Skyscraper provides a detailed account of how scale and proximity shape our understanding of race."

- [**Orientalism and Architectural Culture**](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/socialscientist/pager.html?objectid=HN681.S597_158_048.gif) {2}
	- Authored by [Sibel Bozdogan](https://www.bu.edu/ah/profile/sibel-bozdogan/)
	- "This renewed interest in Islamic architecture demands cautious evaluation since it has a two sided implication. On one hand, it represents an unprecedented platform of discussion for a non-Western transition to modernity. By encouraging research and theorizing, it marks the possibility of authentic theory for cultures ‘peripheral’ to the Western world.” This possibility operates within a history/modernity problematique, It perceives modernity not as a Western category, but as a more or less universal set of problems to which there can be different, authentic responses, dislocated in time and place."

- [**The Cultural Burden of Architecture**]() {2}
	- Authored by [Gülsüm Baydar](https://archnet.org/authorities/6458)
	- "Contemporary architectural discourse mostly assumes an unmediated link between architecture and culture. This is a historical assumption, however, rooted in colonial encounters when the notion of cultural difference first entered the architectural scene. In the first part of my article, I focus on a statement by Vitruvius that provides ways of thinking about architecture outside cultural identity categories. In the second part, I analyze two nineteenth-century texts to show both the cultural inscriptions of architectural discourse and their breaking points. Finally, I argue that recognizing the historicity of the relationship between architecture and culture involves problematizing architecture as an identity category as much as questioning culture as an architectural category."

- [**Ape to Apollo: Aesthetics and the Idea of Race in the 18th Century**](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/files/587103/download?download_frd=1) {2}
	- Authored by [David Bindman](https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/people/david-bndman)
	- "Ape to Apollo is the first book to follow the development in the eighteenth century of the idea of race as it shaped and was shaped by the idea of aesthetics. Twelve full-color illustrations and sixty-five black-and-white illustrations from publications and artists of the day allow the reader to see eighteenth-century concepts of race translated into images. Human "varieties" are marked in such illustrations by exaggerated differences, with emphases on variations from the European ideal and on the characteristics that allegedly divided the races."

	- "This book will enlighten many. By exposing how modern architectural discourse and thought have been influenced quite heavily by racism, this critical and important scholarship sheds new light on the built environment. Race and Modern Architecture ultimately reveals how architecture and design have been silent partners in oppression in the United States and around the globe."

- [**Race and Architectural Geometry: Thomas Jefferson’s Octagons.**](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/578931/pdf) {2}
	- Authored by [Irene C Cheng](https://portal.cca.edu/people/icheng/)
	- "On the topic of race, the study of nineteenth-century American architecture remains troublingly myopic. In the fields of American literary studies and history, the construction of racial difference has become an indispensable subject of analysis, but even some recent surveys of nineteenth-century architecture ignore or downplay the roles of racial ideology, slavery, and nonwhite ethnic groups in shaping the built environment. This neglect persists despite a steady trickle of important research by historians and literary scholars, beginning in the 1980s with the work of Dell Upton and Michael Vlach." (Taken from source)

- [**Building Character: The Racial Politics of Modern Architectural Style**]() {2}
	- Authored by [Charles Davis II](http://ap.buffalo.edu/People/faculty.host.html/content/shared/ap/students-faculty-alumni/faculty/Davis.detail.html)
	- "In the nineteenth-century paradigm of architectural organicism, the notion that buildings possessed character provided architects with a lens for relating the buildings they designed to the populations they served. Advances in scientific race theory enabled designers to think of “race” and “style” as manifestations of natural law: just as biological processes seemed to inherently regulate the racial characters that made humans a perfect fit for their geographical contexts, architectural characters became a rational product of design."

	- Authored by [Darell Wayne Fields](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/darell-fields)
	- "Architecture in Black argues that architecture, as an aesthetic practice, and blackness, as a lingusitic practice, operate within the same semiotic paradigm. The book presents the first systematic analysis of the theoretical relationship between architecture and blackness."

	- Authored by [bell hooks](http://www.bellhooksinstitute.com/#/about)
	- "After the completion of a simple art project, Hooks reflects on how race and class realities would have drastically altered the architecture of her “dream home” if the assignment was not based solely on imagination. She continues on to realize that the African Americans she knew had very little control over spatial inequalities due to their socioeconomic stauses. Although this was the case, The cirscumstances of them being limited to these fixed locations did not halt them from creating and expressing their culture with what they had."

	- Authored by [Mario Gooden](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/faculty/16-mario-gooden)
	- "Gooden examines how architecture shapes and is defined by black identity. The book investigates different aspects of this issue in each of its five essays with discussions ranging from black churches to the history of the avant-garde movement. For Gooden, the central connection between architecture and cultural identity lies in the space created inside buildings."

- [**The Story of an Idea**]() {2}
	- Authored by [Georges Teyssot](https://v2.nl/archive/people/georges-teyssot)
	- "Today, spaces no longer represent a bourgeois haven; nor are they the sites of a classical harmony between work and leisure, private and public, the local and the global. The house is not merely a home but a position for negotiations with multiple spheres—the technological as well as the physical and the psychological. In A Topology of Everyday Constellations, Georges Teyssot considers the intrusion of the public sphere into private space, and the blurring of notions of interior, privacy, and intimacy in our societies. He proposes that we rethink design in terms of a new definition of the practices of everyday life." [Summary c/o MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/topology-everyday-constellations)

- [**Black in Place: The Spatial Aesthetics of Race in a Post-Chocolate City**]() {2}
	- Authored by [Brandi Thompson Summers](https://geography.berkeley.edu/brandi-thompson-summers)
	- "While Washington, D.C., is still often referred to as “Chocolate City,” it has undergone significant demographic, political, and economic change in the last decade. In D.C., no place represents this shift better than the H Street corridor. In this book, Brandi Thompson Summers documents D.C.’s shift to a “post-chocolate” cosmopolitan metropolis by charting H Street’s economic and racial developments. In doing so, she offers a theoretical framework for understanding how blackness is aestheticized and deployed to organize landscapes and raise capital."

	- Authored by [Abigail A. Van Slyck](https://www.conncoll.edu/directories/emeritus-faculty/abigail-van-slyck/)
	- "In many ways, the groundwork for the study of the Southwest's vernacular architecture was laid a century ago, when Anglo-American travelers began to reassess the landscapes they encountered in New Mexico, Arizona, and southern California. While adobe structures had prompted early-nineteenth-century visitors to characterize Santa Fe as "a filthy and dull city of mud," by the 1890s these same buildings were the focus of a full-fledged cultural revival supported by the railroad and the fledgling tourist industry."

	- Authored by [Kazys Varnelis](http://varnelis.net/about/)
	- "In this essay, I analyze the extreme right-wing political philosophy developed and promoted by Philip Johnson between 1932 and 1940 and compare it to the Nietzschean architectural politics he has promoted in the postwar pe­riod. Johnson's intellectual legacy, in particular the architectural theory of Peter Eisenman, is discussed in terms of the "aestheticization" of politics and history. This analysis proceeds in light of German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk's conception of post-1945 "survival" through cynical reason in which one knows that what one is doing is wrong but does it anyway to sur­vive and get ahead. In opposition to Eisenman and Johnson's cynical reason, I propose a return to what Sloterdijk describes as kynicism: the disclosure of the falseness of the cynic and the false structure of cynical society."
