        Although our mission is stated on our home page, it is important to reiterate this message.

      <p style={{padding: "0 1em 0 1em"}}><strong><em>
        For far too long, the worlds of architecture and design have been a plutocracy intent on social atomization and oppression of the Other. This website is intended as an evolving, community-run, open access resource for the democratization of knowledge surrounding architecture, design and any tangential fields.

      <p>
        All choices made surrounding this site should â€”Â and will â€”Â be made according to this principle. As stated, this is meant to be a community effort. While not one of us alone is capable of healing the systemic racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and general bigotry both extant within and created by architecture, design and tangetial fields, together, with effort, we can create change. If there is any additional function this site can take on to accelerate our communal progress towards this goal, <Link href="mailto:hello@just---design.com">please let us know</Link>. Otherwise, if you&apos;d like to help us with the maintenance and development of this site, we&apos;d love that too.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strive for complete transparency.
